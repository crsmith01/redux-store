# User Story
```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```

## Mock-Up
The following animations demonstrate the application's appearance and functionality.

A user can register using the Signup page and then navigate to the Products page:

![A user registers on the Signup page and then navigates to the Products page, which displays images and descriptions of products.](./Assets/22-state-homework-demo-01.gif) 

The user can select a category, choose a product, view details about it on the product page, and add and remove it from their shopping cart:

Finally, the user can check out by going to their shopping cart, as shown in the following animation:
